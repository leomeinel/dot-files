# dot-files

Configuration files and miscellaneous files for my personal linux setups

## Installation

Edit `install.conf` to specify the usernames matching your system. If any of the users are not needed by you, you can just leave them how they are.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leomeinel/dot-files.git ~/.config/home-manager
chmod +x ~/.config/home-manager/set-variables.sh
~/.config/home-manager/set-variables.sh
chmod +x ~/.config/home-manager/setup.sh
~/.config/home-manager/setup.sh
```
